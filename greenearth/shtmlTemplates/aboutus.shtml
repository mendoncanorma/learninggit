                            <div class="customer-testimonial"><p>On an everyday basis, Bluebeam helps create an environment where anything is possible in the creation and modification of PDFs. With the new release of Revu 11, users have even more functionality to work with such as the Format Painter. The capability to copy the formatted appearance from one annotation to another has sped up AS Built documentation tremendously. Also, with the creation of Sets and the ability to split documents into multiple sections, Bluebeam has now evolved the process of forming maintenance manuals into a well-oiled machine. We are more productive and proficient now than ever before as our customers electronically receive clean, professional closing documents. Overall, Bluebeam has allowed us to get an edge on our competition and ultimately go above and beyond our customers’ expectations.</p></div>

                            <div class="customer-testimonial"><p>I wanted to pass along a big thank you for the creation of Revu’s 3D PDF tool. Using Revit Structure, it can often be difficult to help others visualize the locations of the column supports through the building, especially when the columns are offset. We have used this tool to our advantage to help us explain and show exactly how the building elements fit together, without being there to guide the client through the building. It is very satisfying to have a client in the office and open a 3D PDF in front of them. They are impressed right off the bat, but when we start to rotate the building, that's when their jaws drop! We are getting more and more requests from people to get 3D PDFs of projects, so they can 'see' the building and walk around it.</p></div>

                            <div class="customer-testimonial"><p>Bluebeam Revu has helped me revise and check drawings. If there is a revision on the same sheet size, the "Sync" feature works great at zooming in and helping me locate that change. When using pen and paper to check an old revision to a new revision, I would highlight or mark off what I had checked. I am now able to use Bluebeam's "Highlighter" for this and have taken the process paperless. I no longer have to wrestle drawings on my desk top.</p></div>

It not only met our AutoCAD needs but also integrated very well with Office providing all our users with a user-friendly PDF solution.</p></div>

                            <div class="customer-testimonial"><p>We evaluated a number of PDF solutions and selected Bluebeam Revu because its features were clearly designed with an AEC firm in mind. Our technical users have all the advanced features they need to convert complicated AutoCAD drawings to PDF, TIF or JPG, while our other associates can use Bluebeam to easily convert Windows Office documents to secure files that they can easily share by e-mail.</p></div>

                            <div class="customer-testimonial"><p>Bluebeam batch conversion from AutoCAD to PDF saves having to open each drawing file to create a PDF file. The best advantage I see is the fact that after Bluebeam creates a PDF file from a drawing file it does not leave the print file "parked" in Acrobat format so that it has to be changed to print to the printer or plotter.</p></div>
